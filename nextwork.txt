Intelligent Video Surveillance System (IVSS) - Production-Ready Improvements

I. Foundational Security & User Management

1.  User Authentication:
    -   Login/Logout System: Secure user access with username and password authentication.
    -   Password Security: Hash and salt user passwords in the database (e.g., using werkzeug.security) instead of storing them in plain text.
    -   Session Management: Use secure session cookies or tokens (like JWT) to manage user login state.

2.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    -   Admin Role: Full control over the system. Can manage users, configure all cameras and system settings, and view all data.
    -   Operator Role: Limited access. Can view assigned camera feeds, monitor alerts, and acknowledge them, but cannot change critical settings or manage users.

3.  User Management Interface (Admin-only):
    -   A UI page to create, edit, deactivate, and delete user accounts.
    -   Ability to assign roles to users.

II. Enhanced Database & Data Management

1.  Production-Grade Database:
    -   Migrate from SQLite to a more robust client-server database like PostgreSQL or MySQL. This is essential for handling concurrent read/write operations in a production environment.

2.  Refined Database Schema:
    -   `users` table: To store user credentials and roles.
    -   `cameras` table: To manage camera configurations (name, source URL, location).
    -   `detection_settings` table: To store detection parameters (e.g., confidence_threshold, motion_sensitivity) for each camera, making them configurable via the UI.
    -   `alerts` table: Enhance the existing table to include `status` (e.g., "New," "Acknowledged," "False Positive"), `detection_type`, and a foreign key to the user who acknowledged it.

3.  Alert Management & Review:
    -   In the UI, allow users to change an alert's status. This is the foundation for calculating model accuracy.
    -   Implement filtering and searching for alerts (by date, camera, type, status).

III. Advanced UI/UX Functionalities

1.  Dynamic Configuration from UI:
    -   Camera Management: Allow Admins to add, edit, and delete camera feeds directly from the web interface without restarting the application.
    -   Detection Settings: Enable Admins to enable/disable detection types (motion, object, face) and fine-tune their parameters (e.g., confidence scores) per camera via the UI.

2.  Interactive Analytics Dashboard:
    -   Visualize alert data with interactive charts (e.g., alerts per day, alert types by percentage).
    -   Display key performance indicators (KPIs) like the number of active cameras and total alerts today.
    -   If the alert review system is in place, show detection model accuracy (Precision, Recall).

3.  Audit Trail:
    -   Log important user actions (e.g., user login, settings changed, alert acknowledged) to an `audit_log` table for security and accountability.

IV. Backend & System Reliability

1.  Configuration Management:
    -   Externalize sensitive information (database credentials, email passwords) from the code using environment variables or a `.env` file.

2.  Robust Error Handling & Logging:
    -   Implement a centralized logging system (using Python's `logging` module) to record events, warnings, and errors from all running processes into a file.
    -   Improve exception handling to prevent crashes and ensure the system can recover from errors gracefully (e.g., a camera going offline).

3.  Process Health Monitoring:
    -   The main process should monitor the health of its child processes (video capture, detection) and restart them if they fail.

V. Deployment & Operations

1.  Containerization:
    -   Create a `Dockerfile` for the application and a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run the multi-container application (Flask app, detection processes, database). This ensures a consistent and reproducible deployment environment.

2.  Dependency Management:
    -   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is complete and version-pinned for stable builds.

3.  Detailed Documentation:
    -   Update the `README.md` to include instructions for production setup, environment variable configuration, and deployment using Docker.
